// 15. Calculate the percentage of the discount
// A retail store is offering a discount on its products and wants to calculate the percentage of the discount to
// show customers how much they can save. Given the original price and the discounted price of a product,
// implement an arrow function to calculate the percentage of the discount rounded off to two decimal places.
// This function could be useful for the store's marketing team to create promotions and offers that attract customers.


const calculateDiscountPercentage = (originalPrice, discountedPrice) => {
    const discountAmount = originalPrice - discountedPrice;
    const discountPercentage = (discountAmount / originalPrice) * 100;
    return discountPercentage.toFixed(2);
  };

  const originalPrice = 100;
  const discountedPrice = 80;
  
  const discountPercentage = calculateDiscountPercentage(originalPrice, discountedPrice);
  console.log(discountPercentage);
